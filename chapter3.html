            The days stretched long, golden, and warm as the summer deepened, each one bleeding into the next with such ease that Aiden lost track of time. It felt like they had always been here—beneath the grand oak, chasing clouds, and talking about the mysteries of the world. Aiden loved the way the sunlight fell across the fields in the afternoon, making everything glow with a kind of magic that made him believe anything was possible.

            Lila had an infectious energy about her, a joy that made the ordinary seem extraordinary. Whether they were picking flowers or skipping stones by the creek, everything was an adventure in her presence. She never let a moment slip by unnoticed—always finding beauty in the smallest details. Sometimes Aiden would catch her sitting quietly, her eyes half-closed as if she were absorbing the world in some deeper way. It was as if Lila could see colors that others couldn’t—colors that existed just beneath the surface of things, waiting to be discovered.
            
            One afternoon, they were lying in the meadow, watching the sunlight filter through the leaves above. Lila had a handful of wildflowers she’d picked, her fingers absentmindedly weaving them into a delicate chain. Aiden, his arms crossed behind his head, stared up at the sky, watching the soft movement of clouds.
            
            “Do you ever wonder what colors sound like?” Lila asked, breaking the comfortable silence.
            
            Aiden blinked and turned his head toward her, confused but intrigued. “Colors… sound like?”
            
            She nodded, her fingers still working on the flower chain. “Yeah. Like… if you close your eyes and listen really carefully, I bet you could hear the colors of the wind. Or the grass. Or the sky. Everything’s connected, you know? The way the world moves, it all has a rhythm—a sound. But it’s quiet. You have to be still to hear it.”
            
            Aiden smiled at her, marveling at how her mind worked. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard colors before,” he said softly. “Maybe I’m not listening hard enough.”
            
            Lila laughed, a soft, airy sound that made Aiden’s heart feel lighter. “It’s not about listening harder. It’s about feeling them. Here—” She handed him the flower chain she had made. “What color does this sound like to you?”
            
            Aiden took the chain gently, looking down at the pale blue and yellow petals. He thought about it for a moment, trying to understand what she meant. He held the flowers to his ear as a joke, and Lila giggled, but when he closed his eyes and focused on the feeling, something strange happened. The rustle of the leaves, the soft chirping of birds, the gentle hum of the breeze—it all seemed to blend into something more, something unexplainable. He couldn’t put words to it, but there was a sound—faint, delicate, like a whisper. And it was blue.
            
            He opened his eyes slowly and looked at her, the wonder on his face enough to make Lila smile wide. “You hear it, don’t you?” she said, her voice barely a whisper. “I knew you would.”
            
            Aiden nodded, unable to find the words. Lila was right—there was something more to the world, something just beneath the surface. It was in the way the grass swayed, the way the sun painted the horizon in soft pinks and golds at dusk. It was the feeling of the earth breathing beneath them, ancient and alive.
            
            He looked at her, his chest tightening with a feeling he couldn’t quite name. He didn’t want this to end—the colors, the warmth, the way the world felt alive when he was with her. But deep down, he knew. The days were growing shorter, and with each sunset, they were one step closer to the end of summer.
            
            Lila sensed his quiet thoughts, because she leaned over and poked his arm gently. “Don’t think too much, Aiden,” she said, her tone light but her eyes serious. “This is our time. Right now. We’ll figure out the rest later.”
            
            Aiden smiled softly, grateful for her. She always knew what to say. He looked up at the sky once more, watching the colors shift as the day drew to a close. He could hear it now—the sound of summer. And it was beautiful.
