The days were growing shorter. The golden hues of late summer were shifting into the cooler tones of autumn, and with them came an unspoken sense of urgency. Aiden felt it in the air, in the way the evenings seemed to darken a little faster, the way the wind carried a hint of crispness now, teasing at the coming change.

Lila hadn’t mentioned it, but Aiden knew. He could see it in her eyes—the awareness that their time beneath the oak tree, in the wide-open fields, chasing clouds and listening to the colors, was coming to an end. They hadn’t spoken of school or what would happen after the summer; it was as if they both wanted to freeze the world where it was, to pretend that nothing would change. But life, like the seasons, never stood still.

One afternoon, as they sat beneath the oak, Lila broke the silence.

“Do you think we’ll still be the same after this?” she asked quietly, her eyes fixed on the horizon.

Aiden glanced at her, his heart tightening. “What do you mean?”

“I mean… after the summer ends. When we’re not here anymore. When we go back to everything else.” She paused, her voice growing softer. “Will we still be… us?”

Aiden didn’t answer right away. He didn’t know how to. The thought of everything changing—the idea that this magical, endless summer might become nothing more than a memory—frightened him in a way he hadn’t expected. He had always taken comfort in the idea that some things lasted forever, but now, sitting here with Lila, he wasn’t so sure.

“Of course we will,” he said finally, though the words felt hollow even as he spoke them. He wanted to believe it—wanted to believe that nothing could take away what they had. But deep down, he knew that time had a way of changing things, no matter how much you tried to hold on.

Lila didn’t respond, but the look in her eyes told him she understood. She knew, too. They couldn’t stay here forever. The world outside was calling, pulling them away from this safe, sun-drenched place. And though they were still together now, there was a part of her that was already letting go.

They spent the rest of the afternoon in a comfortable silence, watching the sky change from blue to pink to purple. The sun set slowly, casting long shadows across the fields, and for the first time all summer, Aiden felt a chill in the air.

When the stars finally emerged, twinkling above them like scattered diamonds, Lila spoke again, her voice barely above a whisper. “We can’t catch it, Aiden,” she said, echoing the words she had spoken about the clouds, about the ghost. “But we can remember it.”

Aiden looked at her, his chest tight with emotion. “Yeah,” he whispered. “We’ll remember.”

And in that moment, as the stars shimmered above and the cool night air wrapped around them, he realized that remembering—truly remembering—was the only way to hold on.
