        <p class="chapter-content">
            The summer sun burned high above the rolling fields, but beneath the sprawling branches of an ancient oak tree, time seemed to slow. The air was warm, heavy with the scent of wildflowers and ripening fruit, but under that canopy, a cool breeze occasionally brushed their skin, carrying with it the promise of something sweet and distant. Aiden and Lila, no older than twelve, lay on the soft grass, their legs stretched out and ice pops melting slowly in their hands. They could hear the faint hum of the cicadas, a constant background melody of their endless summer days.

Aiden rolled over onto his side, his fingers tracing patterns in the earth. His gaze wandered to the vibrant blue sky, where a lazy cloud drifted above them. It felt like a dream—a dream where days flowed together, and there was nothing beyond the present moment. No worries, no future. Just now.

“Do you ever think about what comes after?” Lila asked suddenly, her voice soft but carrying a weight that contrasted with the carefree nature of their day.

Aiden blinked and glanced over at her. Lila's brown hair was spread out on the grass like a fan, her eyes fixed on the same distant point in the sky. The question made his heart stutter—because he knew what she meant. Summer wouldn’t last forever. This tree, their laughter, the endless stretches of time—all of it would eventually fade.

“After what?” Aiden replied, though he knew the answer.

Lila turned her head toward him, her eyes bright but unreadable. She smiled a little, her lips sticky from the ice pop. “After the summer ends.”

Aiden sighed and lay back again, looking up at the oak’s thick branches swaying gently in the breeze. It was a question they had avoided, but it hovered between them like the invisible dust motes caught in the sun's rays.

“The world’s full of lies,” Lila said suddenly, sitting up, her voice carrying a spark of determination now. “Grown-ups always tell us to enjoy things while they last, but they never tell us why things can’t last forever. Why the good stuff always fades away.” She looked at him then, her expression serious. “But we can find out. We can find out what’s true—what really matters.”

Aiden laughed softly, though the seriousness of her words made his heart ache in a way he didn’t fully understand. “You make it sound like we’re on some big quest,” he said. “But maybe you’re right. Maybe the truth is hiding somewhere, waiting for us to find it.”

Lila grinned, her face lighting up with that childlike excitement he loved. “Exactly! We’ll figure it out together.” She leaned back into the grass, content in her declaration, as if the mere act of saying it made it true.

The breeze picked up, carrying with it the soft scent of lavender from the nearby fields. Aiden closed his eyes and let the warmth of the moment seep into him, trying to hold onto the feeling as long as he could.
