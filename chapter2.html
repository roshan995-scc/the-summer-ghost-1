        <p class="chapter-content">
            The days melted into one another, a seamless blur of sunlight, laughter, and endless afternoons beneath the oak tree. Aiden and Lila spent hours wandering the hills and fields, chasing the wind, racing through wildflower meadows, and always returning to their spot beneath the great oak where the world felt both infinite and safe.

            One afternoon, a particularly fluffy cloud caught Lila’s eye. It was low and slow, drifting lazily just above the horizon, casting a long shadow over the distant hills.
            
            “Look at that one!” Lila exclaimed, pointing. “Doesn’t it look like a dragon?”
            
            Aiden squinted up at the sky, following her finger. The cloud, puffy and uneven, did sort of resemble a dragon, if he squinted just right. Its long, wispy tail trailed behind it, and two bulbous sections formed what could have been wings.
            
            “You’ve got quite the imagination,” he teased, grinning as he shaded his eyes with his hand. “You think everything looks like dragons.”
            
            Lila stuck her tongue out at him playfully, then took off running down the hill, her arms outstretched like wings. Aiden watched her for a moment, the way her hair whipped in the wind and her skirt billowed out like a sail. She always seemed so free, as if she were part of the air itself—untouchable and boundless.
            
            “Come on, slowpoke!” she called over her shoulder, already halfway down the hill. “We’re going to catch it!”
            
            Aiden hesitated for only a moment before sprinting after her, his laughter bubbling up from deep within his chest. They ran until they reached the bottom of the hill, where the earth flattened into a wide, open plain that stretched out toward the horizon. The cloud, now closer, still hovered in the sky, tantalizingly out of reach.
            
            Lila skidded to a stop, her breath coming in short gasps as she stretched her arms up toward the sky. “There! I can almost grab it!” she declared, jumping up and down as if she might actually touch it.
            
            Aiden, panting and grinning, watched her attempt to catch the cloud. There was something beautiful in the way she believed, even for a moment, that she could. The way she threw herself into the impossible, unafraid of disappointment. He admired that about her—the way she faced the world as if it were hers to shape and mold.
            
            Finally, after a few failed attempts, Lila gave up with a dramatic sigh, collapsing into the grass. “Well, I tried,” she said, laughing as she lay sprawled out, her arms and legs stretched wide like a starfish. “It’s harder than it looks.”
            
            Aiden joined her, plopping down beside her with a soft thud. The grass tickled his arms and legs as he lay there, staring up at the cloud that continued its lazy journey across the sky.
            
            “You can’t catch a cloud, you know,” he said after a moment, his voice softer now. “It’s just air.”
            
            Lila turned her head to look at him, her expression unreadable for a second. Then she smiled, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “Maybe not with your hands,” she said. “But you can catch it in other ways.”
            
            Aiden raised an eyebrow, intrigued. “Like how?”
            
            Lila sat up, digging around in the small pouch she always carried with her. She pulled out a stubby pencil and a crumpled piece of paper, smoothing it out on her knee. Then, with a few quick strokes, she began to draw the cloud. Her hands moved with an easy confidence, and soon, the shape of the dragon-cloud appeared on the page, complete with its wispy tail and round wings.
            
            “There,” she said, holding up the paper proudly. “I caught it. Now it’s ours forever.”
            
            Aiden smiled, a warmth spreading through his chest as he looked at the drawing. It was simple, nothing more than a few lines on paper, but somehow, it captured the essence of the moment. The cloud, the breeze, the feeling of freedom and endless possibility—it was all there.
            
            “See?” Lila said, folding the paper neatly and tucking it back into her pouch. “You just have to know how to catch it.”
            
            Aiden lay back again, closing his eyes as the wind picked up, ruffling his hair. He didn’t say anything, but in that moment, he understood. It wasn’t about the cloud—it was about the memory they had created. The way they had laughed and run through the fields, the way the world felt alive and full of wonder.
            
            The cloud would keep moving, and the day would end, but this moment—this feeling—was theirs. Forever.
